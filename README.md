# Arrays-1
Task 1
I used int to intialize the program. To make 100 elemetns the easiest way would be to
use an int to hold the value of 100 making it the most simple way. Then I did a for loop
to print out the vlaues.

Task 3
Reading the value of 100 elemetns would take 1 step or 0(1)
Insertion of the begining of the array would take 101steps or 0(n) linear steps
Insteration at the end of the array would take 1 step it is easier that way because you will just put it at the end instead of moving everything one space away
Deletion at the begining of the array would take 0(n) or 99 steps because you will delete the 1st one and then everything would go down be one
Deletion at the end of the array would take one step becauese you are just deleting the end and nothing else changes

Task 4
This would depend on how big the value is. You would have to check each single one n times so by that logic the answer is o(n) since it is also linear.
